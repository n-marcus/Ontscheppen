# Overview
The "Ontscheppen" or "Decreation" instrument is made up of a large number of solenoids connected to a Teensy (for OSC ethernet or MIDI control) or Arduino Nano (for offline gnerative compositions). The solenoids are attached to a variety of differently sounding surfaces to allow for a wide spectrum of sounds when played.
